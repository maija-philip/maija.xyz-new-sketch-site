    "description": "2024 \n\nThis is the first project I did in my ceramics class. It was the first time I touched ceramics since elementary school and I'm thrilled with how it came out. Everything is hand built and has carved hooks to sit on screws or nails in the wall. \n\nThe blueberries where made by wedging a giant piece of clay,  6in x 6in x 4in, then waiting for it to dry halfway to leather hard and carving out the blueberry. This way I could get the sharp carved edges and have the berry not collapse in on itself. It is completely hollow with a deep shelf on the inside. There are triangular points similar to picture frames to hold the screws or nails in place. \n\nThe flat tiles were made from slabs rolled out to 1/4 in thickness, rolled with a texture, then with a leaf placed on top. These were really hard to keep flat the entire process and it shows as they are a bit warped and do not sit flat on the wall."
