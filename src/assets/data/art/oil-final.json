    "description": "2024 \n\nThis was a final for my oil painting class in college and I'm really proud of it. I came into the class with no experience in oils and I am really happy I got to learn the material in a safe environment. Oils were never a paint I thought I would try because of how toxic they are. You really want to just be in open air with a breeze when painting. Fortunately my school has a dedicated oil painting room with such good air filtration that the entire room's air is replaced every 30s. It was just about the safest place you could experiment with these. On top of that, we were recommended to buy water based oils which are less toxic inherently. It was really interesting to compare this process with acrylic painting which I'm more familiar with."
