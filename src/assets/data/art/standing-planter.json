    "description": "2024 \n\nI really enjoyed making this project. It was one of my ceramic class projects to make a 12in tall or wide planter. I wanted to make something where I could see the water draining through like rain. I also saw a lot of cute planters with arms and legs which prompted me to make this standing guy. \n\nThis final version was my second attempt at this planter, the first attempt was a victim of a kiln casualty where the preheat malfunctioned. It was a really nice experience to get to build this again because I learned so much from the first time that it was much better the second go around."
