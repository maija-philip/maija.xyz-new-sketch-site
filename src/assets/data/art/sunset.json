    "description": "2024 \n\nThis is a redo of an old watercolor I did in 2019. It has been hanging in a sunny room, and was not super bold to begin with, so it is pretty faded by now. I used a new, but similar reference with the same theme and focused on creating really bold colors. I wanted everything to pop and I'm really happy with it."
