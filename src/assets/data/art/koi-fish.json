    "description": "2021 \n\nThis is one of my favorite pieces I have ever created. I love the depth of the water and the texture on top as well as the colors. I'm a really big fan of red and blue together and it works really well in this piece. This was after a few previous attempts at making my portraits more cohesive by adding a background."
