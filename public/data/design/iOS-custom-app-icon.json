    "description": "2024 \n\nSince iOS 14 came out and we could use shortcuts to create custom app icons, I've been customizing my whole homepage. There are definitely drawbacks to what I've done to my homescreen, you have to rely on the app names if you are unfamiliar with my phone's app pattern. That being said, I'm rely much more on where my apps are placed than what they look like, so as long as I keep them in the general same location the icon can be as neutral as I like. \n\nThese are two recent designs I've had on my home screen. I like the dark background that saves my battery life but also feels more 'cool' to me. With that, I use cool bold colors, the more color the better in my life and some fun visuals."
