    "description": "2023 \n\nThis was a very open ended project for one of my classes, the only requirement is that it be built in Flutter. I decided to create a recipe app with custom cute icons that you could choose from. The icons were a really fun thing to design because before this, I hadn't had much experience with icons like this. I also was really into a Material Design scheme for the UI/UX."
