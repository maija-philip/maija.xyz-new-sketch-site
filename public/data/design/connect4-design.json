    "description": "2024 \n\nThis was one of my first successful dark mode designs. I'm much more familiar with light mode design because it's a personal preference, but I really enjoy dark design especially with material cards. \n\nI'm not a fan of the harsh colors of the connect 4 board online, so I changed them into colors that I really enjoy instead :) I also made the board more minimalistic and I love it, however this is not a design a lot of my friends enjoy. It is very tailored towards my personal preferences and that works only because it was a personal project for a class. \n\nOne of my favorite parts of the design is how I use the yellow and pink player colors to tailor the UI for each player during game play."
