    "description": "2021 \n\nHappy Birthday Mom! She requested a digital painting from me, so I picked out a bunch of things that remind me of her and put them together. \n\nFor the background, the golden hills represent the SF Bay Area Hiking that we both love so much along with the California Live Oaks. For the subject, as soon as I saw the reference picture I knew what I wanted, this woman had the most beautiful smile. It reminded me so much of Mom, she loves when people smile and once had a morning routine of smiling at herself in the mirror every morning."
