    "description": "2022 \n\nI was inspired to do this idea by some other artists who created amazing pieces. The idea is to use the color of the paint chip in the painting and work around it. I really enjoy this project and keep making more when I have time. It is really fun to come up with the subject of each chip because I usually don't start with a color, then object."
