    "description": "2025 \n\nI created this while finishing up my senior year in college. It was part of a series of pieces that I used to relearn and expand my digital art style. During college, I did a lot of art, including live figure drawing sessions and furthering my acrylic painting. I was also taking a little break from digital art because most of my friends were more into traditional and it was fun to work with them. Because I was still expanding my art skills during this gap, I found myself in a rut when picking digital art up again. The same techniques I used previously didn't feel quite right. I only realized after this piece, that it was because I had outgrown them. Now I'm working to build them up to the reach the new standard I have."
