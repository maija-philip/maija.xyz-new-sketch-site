    "description": "2022 \n\nI made this in 2021 right before I went into my freshman year of college. I really wanted to bring some of the things I love in watercolor into this piece. When painting in watercolor, I focus on the undertones heavily and bring them out in unrealistic boldness. I tried to replicate that here, but I struggle more with adding such bold colors somewhat randomly, so I stuck with highlight and shadow colors instead. I really like how this piece came out, I'm very happy with it."
