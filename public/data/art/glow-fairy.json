    "description": "2021 \n\nComposition was my focus with this piece. I really enjoy doing portraits, but I was beginning to notice a pattern, they were floating in space and didn't seem to have much meaning. I noticed that artists I looked up to had background even in their portraits. This was one of my first attempts at that and I'm really happy with how it turned out."
