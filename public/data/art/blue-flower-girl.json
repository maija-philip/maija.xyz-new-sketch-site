    "description": "2025 \n\nThis was another one of my bold color watercolor pieces. This piece was the final piece of my series on learning to paint with stronger colors. I really wanted the hair to look and feel dark and the eyes and flowers to pop. I really enjoy working with contrasting colors like red and blue."
